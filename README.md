Example sheet structure:
```
Name          | Email               | Company      | Position
John Doe      | john@example.com    | Acme Corp    | Manager

Use double parentheses to create placeholders that will be replaced with data from your sheet:

- `((Name))` - Replaced with the Name column value
- `((Company))` - Replaced with the Company column value
- `((Position))` - Replaced with the Position column value

**Example Email Template:**
```
Subject: Welcome to our newsletter, ((Name))!

Hello ((Name)),

Thank you for your interest in our services. We noticed you work at ((Company)) as a ((Position)).

Please find our company brochure attached for your reference.

Best regards,
Marketing Team
```

2. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Check your Google Cloud Project setup
   - Ensure APIs are enabled
   - Verify OAuth consent screen configuration

   - Reduce batch size
   - Increase time gaps between emails
   - Check Gmail API quotas in Google Cloud Console

   - Use the "Validate Placeholders" button
   - Improved error handling now provides better feedback
   - Placeholders are case-insensitive and handle empty values

6. **"Attachment too large"**
   - Check individual file sizes
   - Ensure total attachments don't exceed 25MB
   - Use file compression for large documents

7. **"Error fetching placeholder" (FIXED!)**
   - Enhanced placeholder processing with better error handling
   - Supports null/empty values in sheet data
   - Improved validation and debugging

### Best Practices
